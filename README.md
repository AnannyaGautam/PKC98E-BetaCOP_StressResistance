# PKC98E-BetaCOP_StressResistance
Data and R scripts for my Honours thesis on Drosophila melanogaster, investigating how PKC98E and β′COP regulate lipid metabolism, stress resistance, and ageing through RNAi knockdowns, diet assays, and mixed-effects survival models.
The Genotypes in almost all raw data are coded as the LAB-ID for consistency and clarity.
