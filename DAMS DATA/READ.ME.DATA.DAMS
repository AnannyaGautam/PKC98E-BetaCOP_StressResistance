This directory contains all datasets generated from the Drosophila Activity Monitoring System (DAMS) across both pilot and main stress-resistance experiments. The data were collected during starvation and paraquat-induced oxidative stress assays conducted on Drosophila melanogaster using the TriKinetics monitoring platform.

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific experimental batch or condition (e.g., pilot runs, diet optimisations, final assays).

Folder structure

/Pilot_Experiments/ – early runs used for assay optimisation (e.g., paraquat dose, agar concentration).

/Main_Experiments/ – final datasets used in the thesis analysis.

/Output/ – contains raw and parsed data exported from the DAMS File Scan software.

Data format

Within each Output folder:

Files ending with .txt represent monitor-level activity data, where each column corresponds to an individual fly channel.

Activity is binned in 5-minute intervals (each row = 5 min), summing all beam breaks per interval.

Notes

Data are unfiltered exports from the DAMS software; no cleaning or modelling is applied here.

Parsed versions of these files (trimmed to active windows and annotated with genotype and diet) are stored in the respective Analysis subfolders.

The same analysis scripts can be used to read and process all datasets, as they share an identical format and binning scheme.
